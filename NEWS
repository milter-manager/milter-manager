== [release-2-0-0] 2.0.0: 2013-07-25

The major version up about 2 years!

There are no incompatible changes between 1.8.9 and 2.0.0.  This
version is compatible to 1.8.x, so you can upgrade without editing
config files.

The reasons:

  * We are developing milter manager continuously.
  * We think milter manager is stable enough.

We released milter manager 1.8.0 at 2011/06/10. There are 10 releases
between 1.8.0 and 2.0.0. We have developed milter manager continuously.

milter manager 2.0.0 is more stable than 1.8.0, because users have
been increased and reported issues. We have been able to fix problems,
because users have reported a lot of problems. Of course, milter
manager is very stable, and Ruby/milter (functionality which you can
write milter in Ruby) is also stable enough. We have reflected our
knowledge that we have developed milter written in Ruby to
Ruby/milter.

We can say that milter manager 2.0.0 is better than 1.8.0 with
confidence. Let's try milter manager if you haven't used milter
manager yet.

=== New applicable conditions

  * sendmail-compatible:
    It's a feature to avoid macro related incompatibility
    between Sendmail's milter implementation and Postfix's
    milter implementation.

    Workarounds|URL:http://www.postfix.org/MILTER_README.html#workarounds>)))

    It's not an applicable condition but it uses applicable
    condition framework to convert macros passed to a milter
    by MTA. dnsbl-milter can be worked with Postfix without
    a patch(*) by the feature.
