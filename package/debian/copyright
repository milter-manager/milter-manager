License: GFDL
  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
  functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
  assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
  with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
  Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
  to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
  for modifications made by others.
  .
  This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
  works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
  complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
  license designed for free software.
  .
  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
  software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
  program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
  software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
  it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
  whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
  principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
